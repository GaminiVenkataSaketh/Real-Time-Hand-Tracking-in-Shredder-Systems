# Real-Time-Hand-Tracking-in-Shredder-Systems


## What is this project about ?


Real-time hand tracking in shredders uses computer vision and AI to detect hands near hazardous areas, enhancing worker safety. It employs cameras, depth sensors, or infrared tech with machine learning to halt or reverse the shredder upon detection, reducing accident risks with rapid response.

## What will this give you ?

We can use this code to monitor workers safety in real-time while working with shredders.


## How i did it ?

I used Computer vision and SSD(Single Shot MultiBox Detector) for the object detection.

## How to use ?


Clone the repo and Upload the folder into pycharm and run **hand_detection.py** file to detect the hand position in real time.


## Results

-Program detected hand is in safe zone
